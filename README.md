# Remon's user guide
> A short discription of myself

Thank you for taking some of your time to get to know me a little better.
I wrote this user guide as an introduction of myself to other colleagues.
If you have any questions about me, this guide, or have something interesting to share with me, please invite me for a coffee:)

## What gives me energy?
- I like to be challenged and try new things over repetitive work.  
- I prefer to work in a small cross-functional team where the full development stack is managed by the team.
- Frontend development work! (with Vue.js)
- Both Frontend and Backend development have my interest, but most of my experience lies within the Frontend.
- I like to spend some time at the foosball table (and win the game)

## Please ask for my help in case of:
- You want to improve the process of working Scrum.
- You want to build an application with Vue.js
- You want to implement Google Tag Manager or Google Analytics into your app.
- You are wondering what CrossFit is about.
- You can't decide where to go on your next skiing trip.

## Thinking
- During conversations or phone calls i will pay attention to your ideas and what you are telling me. It might happens that i need to process your ideas or the things you say. Please allow me some space to think and find the correct words to express myself.

## Communication and other stuff
- I will always answer your call or message if possible. Usually i will call you back within the same day.
- You are free to contact me via phone, sms, iCloud messenger, Whatsapp, Instagram, email, Slack. It's up to you. Even during the weekends my phone is on. My responsiveness during the weekends and on working days between 17:00 and 19:00 may be slower.
- Sometimes i find it hard to work with Microsoft Outlook/Office 365, but found a way to manage this. If we work at the same company where this tool is the standard way of communication, please don't use the tool as an excuse for not being able to communicate.

## Feedback:
- If you like to provide me with some feedback, please let me know. You can always send me an <a href=":mailto:remonvdeijnden@gmail.com">email</a>
